# Research Seminar
As part of the research seminar "Forschungsprojekt Data Mining im Marketing mit R und Python" by Prof. Dr. Daniel Baier we try to add more exercises and new content whenever we can.

In the python files you will find some introductory scripts for huggingface transformers for sentiment analysis. In the [CUDA_GUIDE](./CUDA_GUIDE.md) you will find instructions to install WSL, CUDA, and tensorflow with GPU support on Windows11 for tensorflow version above 2.10.
